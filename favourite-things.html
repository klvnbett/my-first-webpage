    <h1>the things that impress me</h1>
    <p>i as a student at moringa am interested in understanding the currrent tech and the ever emerging new technologoies that help us solve our daily challenges</p>
    <p>It is at this point that i like to list my most favourite thingds:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>reading tech articles</li>
        <li>practice coding in html javascript and css</li>
        <li> doing networking with people who have the same intreset</li>
        <li> studiyng networking as partime</li>
        <li> farming which is the major backbonre t our economy</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Finally we should all embrace to be evolving and adapt to the ever changing world but we should be consistent with the truth that we should learn</p>
